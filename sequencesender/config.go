	// MaxTxSizeForL1 is the maximum size a single transaction can have. This field has
	// non-trivial consequences: larger transactions than 128KB are significantly harder and

	// to avoid the TX getting reverted in case something has changed in the network
	// state after the estimation which can cause the TX to require more gas to be
